# PhantomForestGL
A week-long project developed in 2019, serving as an introduction to C++, OpenGL, and GLUT. This demo project was a collaborative effort to familiarize ourselves ([@VBoschMatas](https://github.com/VBoschMatas) and me [@DinDotDout](https://github.com/DinDotDout)) with both the language and the libraries.
